### Screencasts/Demo Gifs Guidelines

Here are some guidelines and links for creating good screencasts. It is good to get ready now to learn how to create demo videos for your future project milestones and career.

A general guideline: Do whatever it would do if you were teaching someone how to do something. For example, you donâ€™t have to show people you typing and creating the whole commit, but you might want to show the contents of the hook in a text editor, before doing a commit.
